                        <p>The purpose of this project is to create a visualization tool for the most popular sorting algorithms, including selection 
                            sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and shell short. This tool can be used as a learning tool, as an 
                            educational demonstration, or just for recreational purposes. The program allows for adjustments in the size of the array
                            to be sorted, the sortedness (how sorted the array initally is) of the array, and the sorting speed. Different values in the array
                            are represented by rectangular bars with different heights. The program effecitvely visualizes the sorting process through color changes and 
                            continuous changes in the positions of the rectangular bars.

                        <p>The program was built as a webpage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To animate the sorting algorithms, the setInterval() method 
                            was used to repeatedly call a function at specified intervals. Therefore, each sorting algorithm, including merge sort and quick sort, 
                            had to be written using an iterative implementation.

                        <h1>Purpose and What it Does</h1>
                        <p>School attendance zones are defined as the outlines in a school district where students will attend public schools. 
                            A major problem with current school attendance zones is that they are often created without consideration of the racial/ethnic demographics in zones; 
                            This consequently leads to the creation of segregated school attendane zones and segregated classrooms. 
                            The purpose of this project is to create school attendance zones for a region that have racial/ethnic demographics that beter reflect the demographics of the 
                            overall region while still mantaining contiguity and compactness.
                         </p>
                         <p> By utilizing a novel algorithm that combines US demographic data of census block groups and a similar partitioning method to Vornoi polygons, 
                            <b>the program succesfully creates school attendance zones that are signifcantly less segregated than the current school zones implemented in 
                            the targeted regions.</b> Testing on several regions including Maricopa County (Phoenix) and Suffolk County (Boston), the program was able to create
                            configurations of attendance zones with an <b>average 37% improvement from the current school zones</b> when looking at the percent difference in demographics 
                            between the overall region and the actual schools. 
                         </p>

                        <h1>How I Built It</h1>
                        <p>To ensure that the school attendance zones are the most racially/ethnically diverse, the zones were centered around census block groups with the highest "diversity scores,"
                            a score that is calcualted using a novel algoirthm. The remaining block groups are partitioned based on a distance formula. In order to organize the census data, a 'BlockGroup' struct
                            and 'SchoolAttendanceZone' struct were defined. These data-types also allow for easy future implemention of other races and ethnicities into the algoirthm. To create a visualization
                            tool for the newly created school attendance zones, the QPainter class was utilized to map out each attendance zone and the block groups contained within.

                        <h1>Purpose and What it Does</h1>
                        <p>This program uses the Huffman coding algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) for compression and decompression. The purpose of this program is to compress any large text files.
                             The same program can also be used to decompress the resulting compressed file and faithfully reproduce the original.

                        <h1>How I Built It</h1>
                        <p>To build the compression and decompression tools, I used a binary encoding tree built from an 'EncodingTreeNode' struct. Additionly, I had to use a 
                            priority queue when building the huffman tree from the given text. The given text was compressed as bits using the huffman tree, and the final huffman
                            tree and compressed texts were written to a file. The decompression simply reversed this process and used the huffman tree to reconstruct the original
                            file.
